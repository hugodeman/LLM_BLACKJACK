Once that round of play is over, the dealer shuffles all the cards, prepares \nthem for the cut, places the cards in the shoe, and the game continues. \nBasic Strategy \nWinning tactics in Blackjack require that the player play each hand in the optimum way, \nand such strategy always takes into account what the dealer's upcard is. When the \ndealer's upcard is a good one, a 7, 8, 9, 10-card, or ace for example, the player should \nnot stop drawing until a total of 17 or more is reached. When the dealer's upcard is a \npoor one, 4, 5, or 6, the player should stop drawing as soon as he gets a total of 12 or","metadata":{"source":"./BlackJack_Rules.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Hugo Both (1078703)","Creator":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","Producer":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","CreationDate":"D:20250416160200+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20250416160200+02'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","dc:creator":"Hugo Both (1078703)","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","xmp:createdate":"2025-04-16T16:02:00+02:00","xmp:modifydate":"2025-04-16T16:02:00+02:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:CAE1D8B7-0026-4AFF-9607-B5391B3DAF99","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:CAE1D8B7-0026-4AFF-9607-B5391B3DAF99"}},"totalPages":5},"loc":{"pageNumber":4,"lines":{"from":11,"to":23}}}}],["6b9d5599-5995-4198-af17-394ed561601a",{"pageContent":"not stop drawing until a total of 17 or more is reached. When the dealer's upcard is a \npoor one, 4, 5, or 6, the player should stop drawing as soon as he gets a total of 12 or \nhigher. The strategy here is never to take a card if there is any chance of going bust. The \ndesire with this poor holding is to let the dealer hit and hopefully go over 21. Finally, \nwhen the dealer's up card is a fair one, 2 or 3, the player should stop with a total of 13 or \nhigher. \nWith a soft hand, the general strategy is to keep hitting until a total of at least 18 is \nreached. Thus, with an ace and a six (7 or 17), the player would not stop at 17, but would \nhit. \nThe basic strategy for doubling down is as follows: With a total of 11, the player should \nalways double down. With a total of 10, he should double down unless the dealer shows \na ten-card or an ace. With a total of 9, the player should double down only if the dealer's \ncard is fair or poor (2 through 6).","metadata":{"source":"./BlackJack_Rules.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.7","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Author":"Hugo Both (1078703)","Creator":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","Producer":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","CreationDate":"D:20250416160200+02'00'","ModDate":"D:20250416160200+02'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"pdf:producer":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","dc:creator":"Hugo Both (1078703)","xmp:creatortool":"Microsoft® Word voor Microsoft 365","xmp:createdate":"2025-04-16T16:02:00+02:00","xmp:modifydate":"2025-04-16T16:02:00+02:00","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:CAE1D8B7-0026-4AFF-9607-B5391B3DAF99","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:CAE1D8B7-0026-4AFF-9607-B5391B3DAF99"}},"totalPages":5},"loc":{"pageNumber":4,"lines":{"from":22,"to":34}}}}],["f0001d5c-0648-4634-a1cf-f43746d47d04",{"pageContent":"a ten-card or an ace.
